This notebook is dedicated on displaying accuracy results on detecting ghost jobs by adding these three features into any dataset such as Kaggle Fake and Real Jobs, EMSCAD, etc:

Company stock prices using the yfinance library
Layoff rates using Layoff.fyi
Job reposts made by the same company through manual implementation
These features will be trained and tested with BERT, Bi-LTSM, and other traditional NLP models.
